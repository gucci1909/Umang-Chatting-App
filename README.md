# Umang-Chatting-App

>Chatting app allows you to communicate with people through chat. It enables you to send and receive messages. It also allows you to delete or modify your own messages . Fell safe signing up in this app as I've used firebase for that and then , chat with people . The best thing about the app is that your messages will be automatically deleted after it reaches a certain limit in the chat box .
